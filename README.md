# Birdbear Wrapper
### Download Every Medias You Liked on Twitter!
That's right! All the porn tweets you liked, even videos!

## Get Started
This software is a downloader for [BirdBear](https://birdbear.app/), you have to synchronize your liked tweets here.
Once you're done, query `SELECT * FROM tweets;` in the generated SQL Database.

Copypaste the results in `input.json` in the wrapper's directory.

Run `downloadmanager.py`. 

## Why ?
I'm planning to yeet my Twitter account out of existence, but I love archiving and saving stuff. And removing my Twitter account will remove everything I saved. I discovered [BirdBear](https://birdbear.app/) and I see it working perfectly, the only thing missing is to download every images, videos and memes I liked into a folder. So I have the solution for this.
